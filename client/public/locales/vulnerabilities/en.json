  "CNA_DESCRIPTION": "A CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) is an organization authorized by the CVE Program to identify, define, and assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities in software or hardware. CNAs play a crucial role in the vulnerability disclosure process by ensuring that vulnerabilities are accurately documented and made publicly available in the CVE List. Each CNA is responsible for handling vulnerabilities within their specific scope, which may include their own products, third-party software, or a particular vendor community. This helps maintain consistency and transparency in cybersecurity reporting.",
